Tasks for the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).

## Description

The Eudyptula Challenge was a series of programming exercises for the Linux kernel, that started from a very basic "Hello world" kernel module, moving on up in complexity to getting patches accepted into the main Linux kernel source tree.

All the challenges can be found in the CHALLENGE.md file.
